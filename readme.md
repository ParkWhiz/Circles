#Circles

Circles lets you add a subtle yet beautiful dynamic background to any view controller. Use it to add life and color to plain view controllers.

###What it does
Using `CAEmitterLayer`, Circles emits tranquil moving, colorful circles that flow gently across the screen. A visual effect view is placed on top that blurs the colors and creates a very pleasent effect.

###Example
Notice the subtle moving colors in the background. (Best seen on retina displays or actual iOS devices)

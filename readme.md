#Circles

Circles lets you add a subtle yet beautiful dynamic background to any view controller. Use it to bring life and color to plain and boring view controllers.

###What it does
Using `CAEmitterLayer`, Circles emits tranquil moving, colorful circles that flow gently across the screen. A visual effect view is placed on top that blurs the colors and creates a very pleasant effect.

###Example
Notice the subtle moving colors in the background. (Best seen on retina displays or actual iOS devices)

##Instructions

1. To add circles to any view controller, simply have your controller inherit from `PWCirclesViewController`.

2. Add the `emitter-circle` PNG asset to your project.

If you don't want your controller to inherit from this class, or if your controller is already inheriting from another class, you can simply copy the code from PWCirclesViewController into your own controller.
